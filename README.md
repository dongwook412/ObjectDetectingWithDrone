## Object Detecting with drone using Intel's CNN algorithm

### Data

* A video shot through the drones in cage using our scenario

#### Scenario
* Think of the drones as surveillance cameras. Implementing an Android app that sends a warning message and outputs a voice when a driver is in a car and has a cat, a person, or a dog on the road

* In a similar situation, Implementing an Android app that will alert people if there is a car, bus, or motorcycle on the road, trying to cross the road from a person's point of view.

### Method & Tool

* Intel's CNN algorithm(I can not share because Intel has copyright)

* Socket Networking with java

* Android studio for implementing Android app
